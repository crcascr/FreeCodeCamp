# Review Algorithmic Thinking by Building a Dice Game

## Description

Algorithmic thinking involves the ability to break down complex problems into a sequence of well-defined, step-by-step instructions.

In this Dice game project, youâ€™ll learn how to manage game state, implement game logic for rolling dice, keeping score, and applying rules for various combinations.

This project covers concepts such as event handling, array manipulation, conditional logic, and updating the user interface dynamically based on game state.
