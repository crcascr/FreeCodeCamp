One common aspect of building web applications: processing datasets, and then outputting information to the screen. In this sports team cards project, you'll learn how to work with DOM manipulation, object destructuring, event handling, and data filtering.

This project will cover concepts like switch statements, default parameters, `Object.freeze()`, the `map()`, method, and more.
