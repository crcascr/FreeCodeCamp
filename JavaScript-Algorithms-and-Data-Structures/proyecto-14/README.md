# Learn Advanced Array Methods by Building a Statistics Calculator

## Description

As you expand your JavaScript skills, you'll want to get comfortable with array manipulation methods, such as `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()`.

In this statistics calculator project, you'll gain experience with handling user input, DOM manipulation, and method chaining. You'll get practice by performing statistical calculations like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
